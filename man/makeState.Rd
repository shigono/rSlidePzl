\usage{
makeState(pieces)
}
\arguments{
\item{pieces}{a list of objects of 'slidepzl_piece' class.
They can have NAs in their locations.}
}
\value{
an object of class "slidepzl_state", which is a list with following elements:
        \describe{
          \item{piecetypes}{
            a character vector, whose ith element gives the 'type' of ith piece.
          }
          \item{piecelocs}{
          a numeric matrix of size (k, 2),
          where k is the number of pieces on the board.
          The ith row gives (row, column) of the upper left corner
          of the ith piece. It can have NAs.
          }
        }
        Validity of the state is not guaranteed.
