\usage{
makeSetting(boardsize, piecesize)
}
\arguments{
\item{boardsize}{a numeric vector of length 2.

                 (number of rows, number of columns) of the board.
                 Should be >= 1 and <= 9.}

\item{piecesize}{a named list.

                 The name of each element should be a alphabetic character
                 representing a type of piece. Case sensitive.
                 Duplicated names are not allowed.

                 Each element should be a numeric vector of length 2,
                 giving (vertical size, horizontal size) of that type of piece.
                 Should be >= 1 and <= 9.}
}
\value{
an object of class 'slidepzl_setting',
        which is a list with following elements:
        \describe{
          \item{boardsize}{
            same as \code{boardsize} argument
          }
          \item{piecearea}{
            a named list.

            The name of each element is a alphabetic character,
            giving the 'type' of piece.

            Each element is a numeric matrix of size (k,2),
            giving relative locations of cells which that type of piece occupies.
          }
        }
